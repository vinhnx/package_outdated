A small CLI tool to check project's Swift Package Manager dependencies' local version with remote latest version. 

Like Cocoapods's `pod outdated` or Carthage's `carthage outdated`, but for Swift Package Manager.

Currently, it will just output local dependency version and compare with latest git remote version. 

In the future, I will try to support local dependency path and attempt to mimic the like of Cocoapods and Carthage.

This meant for personal educational purpose as I'm learning to write Swift scripting, but feel free to use in your project if you see fit. Pull PR is very welcome ðŸ˜„ !
